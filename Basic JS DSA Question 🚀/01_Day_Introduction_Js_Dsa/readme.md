## Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)


## What is DSA?


Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are methods used in programming to organize and manage data effectively. They help us store and retrieve data in an efficient manner.



Data Structures aur Algorithms (DSA) programming mein data ko organize aur manage karne ke tareeqe hain. Yeh humein data ko efficient tareeke se store karne aur retrieve karne mein madad karte hain, jo system ki performance ko improve karta hai.



 **Data Structures:** 


- These are ways to organize and store data efficiently. Examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.


- Data Structures Data ko specific format mein store karte hain, jisse data access aur manipulation aasaan hota hai. Common data structures mein arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, aur graphs shamil hain. Har data structure ki apni strengths aur limitations hoti hain, aur yeh specific problems ke liye use kiye jaate hain.

**Algorithms:**

 These are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. Examples include sorting algorithms (like quicksort and mergesort) and searching algorithms (like binary search).



Yeh step-by-step instructions hain jo data ko process karne ke liye use kiye jaate hain. Algorithms ka purpose hota hai data ko efficiently sort, search, aur compute karna. Kuch key concepts hain:


Efficient algorithms data ko jaldi aur kam resources ke saath process karne mein madad karte hain.

In dono ke combination se hum data ko organize kar sakte hain aur system ki performance ko improve kar sakte hain. Jaise agar aapko ek large dataset mein se specific information nikalni hai, toh ek efficient algorithm aur suitable data structure use karke aap ye task asaani se kar sakte hain, bina zyada time waste kiye.
